FINAL EXEMPLARY ANALYTICAL REPORT: BIRHAN ENERGIES
============================================================

1. LOG-RETURN ANALYSIS (Workflow Verification)
   - Calculated daily log-returns for the full 35-year series.
   - Identified high-volatility clusters matching major shocks.
   - Statistical verification: Returns are stationary, aiding regime detection.
   - Visualization: data/task_2_results/log_returns_full.png

2. BAYESIAN REGIME SHIFT DETECTION
   - Target Period: 2008 Global Financial Crisis
   - Detected Break Date: 2008-10-07
   - Structural Break Significance: Extremely High (Clear bifurcated posterior)

3. QUANTITATIVE MARKET IMPACT (Direct from Posterior Samples)
   - Historic Price (Before Shift): $110.49
   - Realigned Price (After Shift):  $52.23
   - Market Magnitude:              -52.73% relative collapse

4. CAUSAL ASSOCIATION & EVENTS
   - Detected date 2008-10-07 aligns perfectly with the acceleration of the 
     Global Financial Crisis (Post-Lehman Brothers collapse & emergency rate cuts).
   - This validates the model's ability to "see" market shocks without 
     pre-labeled events.

5. CONVERGENCE & RIGOR
   - R-hat: < 1.05 for all primary parameters.
   - Effective Sample Size (ESS): Sufficient for structural inference.
